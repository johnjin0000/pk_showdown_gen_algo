# populations depending on usage rate
# normalize usage rates (softmax on usage rate)

# sample from population, create n teams

# eval fitness

# select parents, where more fit parents are more likely to be chosen

# reproduce, crossing over random genes => create new generation

# top p% of generation goes directly over to new generation

# random mutation

# evaluate fitness of new population
